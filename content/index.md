The Lair of Incitatus
===============================

Hi!

I am Incitatus, and I'm currently studying web programming at BTH.

I am somewhat of a vampire in terms of rarely getting stuck in pictures - alternatively, I don't have a lot of photo-happy friends, you decide - so this one of me, dressed up as a werewolf, is not only less than a year old, but also a favorite. I *am* rather proud of that costume, so it's not like I mind flinging it at everyone...

I am a northern soul living on the Swedish west coast. I have a huge derpy horse, whom I love dearly and spend a lot of time with. I also have two fluffy cats, but they prefer being anonymous. Cats, y'know. ;)

Web design and programming is something I've been poking at for over a decade now. I took my first steps in the early 00s, picking apart HTML tables and discovering the wonders of the *colspan* property. Slowly I gravitated to the realm of CSS, learning both the basics and some of its more complicated uses. I first touched PHP back in 2012, and began experimenting with jQuery thereabouts as well. There's been huge gaps in my knowledge due to the fact that I've worked almost exclusively within the software MyBB, but, meh. I've been having fun, and I'm still having fun learning properly!
