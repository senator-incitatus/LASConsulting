This website was designed by Incitatus, to be our new platform for reaching our clients, both new and old. It should offer up-to-date information about our services and going-ons, while also giving room for publishing thoughts about our principles and ethics. Visually, it should appeal to the high-end business corporations that are our primary target audience.
