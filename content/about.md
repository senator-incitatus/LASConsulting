About this site
==============================================

This site is part of my studies at BTH, specifically for the [dbwebb course design](http://dbwebb.se/design). It focuses on frameworks - specifically Anax Flat - and, unsurprisingly, website design.

You can find my GitHub repo for my "me site" [here](https://github.com/senator-incitatus/anax-flat).
