About this site
==============================================

This site is part of my studies at BTH, specifically for the [dbwebb course design](http://dbwebb.se/design). It focuses on frameworks - specifically Anax Flat - and, unsurprisingly, website design.

You can find my GitHub repo for my "me site" [here](linktobe.com).

Here is a picture of flax flowers. Why? Because my brain keeps insisting Anax Flat has "flax" in it somewhere. And, y'know, flax is a nice plant.
